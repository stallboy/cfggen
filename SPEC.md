之后都用中文回答。我的意图是：增加app目录下java项目的测试。提高测试覆盖率。项目的文档可参考docs\docs\cfggen\目录下
的md文件。测试要遵循以下准则：
- Test Behavior, Not Implementation: Focus tests on what the code does, not how it does it, to reduce brittleness
- Clear Test Names: Use descriptive names that explain what's being tested and the expected outcome
- Mock External Dependencies: Isolate units by mocking databases, APIs, file systems, and other external services
- Fast Execution: Keep unit tests fast (milliseconds) so developers run them frequently during development
```
